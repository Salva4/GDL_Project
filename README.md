# GDL_Project - Coding GNNs    --- Vinaik Chhetri & Marc Salvad√≥ Benasco

Here is the implementation in Tensorflow-Spektral of 3 models: 
- GATv2: How Attentive are Graph Attention Networks?
- FAGCN: Beyond Low-frequency Information in Graph Convolutional Networks
- GCNII: Simple and Deep Graph Convolutional Networks

The first two are handed in via a Colab file (python file also included).
The third one is handed in in python files and directories for the data. (Instructions in README inside folder.)
